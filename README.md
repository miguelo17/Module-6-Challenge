# Module-6-Challenge
API module challenge
In this module 6 APIs Challenge we put to the test 2 different web APIs that helped us consult data through requests. We extracted information related to weather and cities, also from categories like hotels. Now with the information we analyzed it with graphical display of scatter plots and regression values.
This method will be very useful to build data frame according to specific information within our needs.
